     * The {@code Long} class wraps a value of the primitive type {@code
     * long} in an object. An object of type {@code Long} contains a
     * single field whose type is {@code long}.
     *
     * <p> In addition, this class provides several methods for converting
     * a {@code long} to a {@code String} and a {@code String} to a {@code
     * long}, as well as other constants and methods useful when dealing
     * with a {@code long}.
     *
     * <p>Implementation note: The implementations of the "bit twiddling"
     * methods (such as {@link #highestOneBit(long) highestOneBit} and
     * {@link #numberOfTrailingZeros(long) numberOfTrailingZeros}) are
     * based on material from Henry S. Warren, Jr.'s <i>Hacker's
     * Delight</i>, (Addison Wesley, 2002).
